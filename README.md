# Reconner

This project helps you to automate the reconnaissance part while researching on a particular target.

You just have to replace the [file_path_] text in the script with your local computer's file path in which you have the data or you want to store the data accordingly.

To start :

First of all you can direclty exceute the script by providing the necessary exceutable permissions and then by typing 

Command :-  ./reconner.sh [target name] ( for example : ./reconner.sh tesla.com )

The above given command will execute the script and provid you with the recon data, given that all the necessary tools are alredy installed in your given enviornment and all them are on the right path.

Required tools for this to exceute properly :

assetfinder
amass
arjun
cloudfail
corscanner
dirsearch
subjack
subover
subzy
subfinder
scripthunter
waybackurls
Tko-subs


Note

To make it more convenient you can add this script to your bash_profile and then you can directly source that file and exceute the command from where ever you want.
